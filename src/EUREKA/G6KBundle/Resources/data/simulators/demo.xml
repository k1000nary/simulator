	<Description>The amount of the pension by child is calculated in proportion to the income, net by a minimum living wage (€ 550.93), by a debtor parent. This proportion is different according to the total number of children chargeable to the debtor parent (whatever is the union from which they were born) and the amplitude of the right of access and the accommodation (reduced, classic, or alternated without spontaneous sharing of expenses).</Description>

It can consist of a right of access and infrequent hosting because of the unavailability of the parent, or in a simple right of access, without hosting, if the parent does not arrange condition of adequate hosting or if this hosting would not be in accordance with the interest of the child;

<strong>classic</strong>: the residence is mainly fixed at one of the parents and the time of residence at the other parent is equivalent to 1/4 of the time( of global residence (ex: a weekend on two and half of the school holidays).;

<strong>alternated</strong>: the children live alternately in the residence of each of the parents. The alternated residence can give rise to contribution  to the education of the children when the parents did not agree on the sharing of expenses bound to the child according to their resources or when one of the parents cannot assume only the financial charge of the alternated residence.
